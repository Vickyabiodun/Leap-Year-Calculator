    <h1>Leap Year Checker</h1>
    <p>This Python code receives user input and determines whether the entered year is a leap year or not.</p>
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>A leap year is said to be divisble by 4 with no remainder and divisble by 100 with remainder, or divisible by 400 with no remainder and divisble by 100 with remainder. The code uses an if-elif-else statement to check whether the entered year satisfies these conditions and prints the appropriate message.</p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>To use the code, simply run it in a Python interpreter and enter the year you want to check when prompted. The code will then print whether the entered year is a leap year or not.</p>
